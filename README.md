#condition ratings are based on a scale of 0-9 and N if non applicable

#Not applicable. Use when bridge is not over a waterway (channel).

#0 being bridge closed because of chanel failure. Needs replacement

#1 Bridge closed because of channel failure. Corrective action may put
back in light service.

#2 The channel has changed to the extent the bridge is near a state of
collapse.

#3 Bank protection has failed. River control devices have been
destroyed. Stream bed aggradation, degradation or lateral movement
has changed the channel to now threaten the bridge and/or approach
roadway

#4 Bank and embankment protection is severely undermined. River
control devices have severe damage. Large deposits of debris are in
the channel.

#5 Bank protection is being eroded. River control devices and/or
embankment have major damage. Trees and brush restrict the channel.

#6 Bank is beginning to slump. River control devices and embankment
protection have widespread minor damage. There is minor stream bed
movement evident. Debris is restricting the channel slightly.

#7 Bank protection is in need of minor repairs. River control devices
and embankment protection have a little minor damage. Banks and/or
channel have minor amounts of drift.

#8 Banks are protected or well vegetated. River control devices such
as spur dikes and embankment protection are not required or are in a
stable condition

#9 being there are no noticeable deficencies

#all of the numbers have a corresponding descriptive reason rating 
#which I feel warrants being used converted into factors versus having
